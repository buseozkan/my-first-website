In 2019 I have started writing in a non-profitable blog with my friends, named Tabella. 
After that I have realised how much I love writing and expressing myself.
I like to reach as many people as I can, and maybe change their life or even make them have second thoughts, it is important to question. 
My â€‹posts are not related to any organisation, neither profitable nor non-profitable, I write to entertain myself and you, readers. 
My posts can be sometimes related to each other or completely different from each other, there is no pattern here. 
I like random.
